Write a military-style feedback note using the details below. Refer to the individual as "{full_name}" throughout the write-up.

Event Description: {event_description}
Who and What: {q1}
Where and Why: {q2}
How and Outcome: {q3}

Start with 3‚Äì5 competencies with performance ratings (E, HE, etc.). Use this format:

Event Description:
Initiative: Proactive Problem Solving (HE) ‚Äì [short rationale]
...
[1‚Äì2 paragraph description]

Outcome:
[2‚Äì3 sentence measurable or strategic result]

Important Notes:
- Competencies pulled from one rank higher must be labeled, e.g. ‚ÄúAdaptability (HE ‚Äì Sgt Competency: [definition])‚Äù.
- Use only E or HE ratings unless otherwise justified.
- Write in formal narrative voice without using bullets or informal tone.
