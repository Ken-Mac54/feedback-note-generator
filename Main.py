        Using the input above, generate a formal       military-style feedback note.

        Start with 3‚Äì5 competencies and  sub-competencies with performance ratings (E, HE,   etc.). Use the following format:

Event Description:
Communication: Written Communication (HE) ‚Äì [short rationale]
...
[1‚Äì2 paragraph description using the member's rank and last name on first mention, then only they/them/their pronouns thereafter.]

Outcome:
[2‚Äì3 sentence measurable or strategic result.]

Note:

Use only the format "Core Competency: Sub-competency (Score) ‚Äì rationale".

If a competency is pulled from a higher rank, it must be labeled with that rank and scored no lower than HE (e.g. "(HE ‚Äì Sgt Competency: [definition])").

If the user has selected specific competencies, prioritize including them when reasonably justified by the event. If they are a stretch or not applicable, omit them.

Avoid referring to the member only by rank. Use the abbreviated rank format (e.g., "MCpl") followed by the last name for the first mention (e.g., "MCpl Macpherson"), and then refer to them using they/them pronouns only. Do not spell out rank names like 'Master Corporal'.
