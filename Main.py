Using the input above, generate a formal military-style feedback note.

Start with 3‚Äì5 valid competencies and facets from the list below. Use only the following format for each:

Competency: Facet (Score) ‚Äì rationale

Only use valid competency:facet pairs from this list:
{valid_pairs_text}

Do not invent new combinations. Do not use competencies from other ranks. Avoid generic phrasing like 'Leadership' without a facet.

Structure:
Event Description:
[3‚Äì5 competency/facet lines formatted as above]
[1‚Äì2 paragraph description using the member's rank and last name on first mention, then only they/them/their pronouns thereafter.]

Outcome:
[2‚Äì3 sentence measurable or strategic result.]

Use abbreviated rank format (e.g., MCpl Macpherson), and do not spell out ranks. Use they/them pronouns consistently after the first mention.
